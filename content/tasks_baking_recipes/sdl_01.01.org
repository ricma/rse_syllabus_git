*** SDL 01.01 - Create a New Repository
First we need to create a new repository. It will start out as empty
and we will add a first file.

**** Using the Command Line                                            :cmds:
#+begin_src shell-script
  cd ~/                   # Go to your home directory
  mkdir recipe_book       # create a folder named "recipe_book"
  git init recipe_book    # create an empty git repository
  cd recipe_book
                          # set name and email if we don't want to
                          # use global default (optional)
  git config --local user.name "Martin Richter"
  git config --local user.email "martin.richter@nottingham.ac.uk"
  # create a README file (good practice!)
  echo "A collection of recipes" > README.md
  # and add it to the index (= mark it for being saved in the repo)
  git add README.md
  # register the marked changes in the repository
  git commit -m 'initial commit for recipes'
#+end_src

**** Your Task                                                         :task:
Repeat the above steps and create our own repository with an initial
commit. Feel free to change the names of the repository, the content
of the ~README.md~, and, of course, the name and email.

Keep the name of the ~README.md~ file though - /github/ will later use
the format of this file to display its content nicely.
