* SDL - Creating new Branches
We will mimic different versions of a piece of software by introducing
different versions of recipes: We will create a vegan and a gluten
free version.

We do this by creating new /branches/. In simple terms, a branch is
just a name of a variable which references a point in our repository
history and which allows us to continue development from there.

** Create new branches                                                 :cmds:
To create a new branch at the current state, we can type ~git branch
gluten_free~. This creates a new branch called =gluten_free=
referencing the same point as the current state of the repository.

Now, a call to ~git log~ tells us that there is another branch:
#+begin_src shell-script
git log --oneline --max-count 2
#+end_src
#+begin_example
7d4a511 (HEAD -> master, gluten_free) add link in cinnamon star recipe
bd180d6 restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example

The line ~HEAD -> master~ tells us that our current working directory
is still on the old, original branch called =master=. Note that both
branches reference the same commit (~7d4a511~ in this case) and
therefore represent the same state of the repository.

To switch to the new branch, we can use
#+begin_src shell-script
git checkout gluten_free
#+end_src
and now the above ~git log~ would give
#+begin_example
7d4a511 (HEAD -> gluten_free, master) add link in cinnamon star recipe
bd180d6 restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example

We can see which branch we are on by calling ~git branch~ without any
further arguments:
#+begin_src shell-script
git branch
#+end_src
#+begin_example
 * gluten_free
   master
#+end_example
We get a list of all available branches and the one we are on is
marked with an asterisk.

** Add content to the new branch
To see the full benefit of branches, let us change some of the
contents to make the recipe gluten free:
#+begin_example
# Ingredients
150g buckwheat flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
110g butter
110g sugar
3tsp vanilla extract
pinch of salt
1 egg.

# Steps
- Mix butter and sugar, then whisk in egg
- add flour, baking powder, salt and stir until comes together
- let rest for 30 min in fridge
- roll out and cut into shape
- Bake for 12 - 15 minutes (180 degrees)
#+end_example

With the file ~biscuits.txt~ changed like this we can add it to the
staging area and commit it (see [[file:sdl_change_files.01.org::*SDL - Changing existing files][SDL - Changing existing files]]):
#+begin_src shell-script
  git add biscuits.txt
  git commit -m 'make biscuits recipe gluten free'
#+end_src
#+begin_example
[gluten_free 01bb2d4] make biscuits recipe gluten free
 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)
#+end_example

If we now have a look at
#+begin_src shell-script
git log --oneline --max-count=3
#+end_src
#+begin_example
01bb2d4 (HEAD -> gluten_free) make biscuits recipe gluten free
7d4a511 (master) add link in cinnamon star recipe
bd180d6 restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example
we see that our old branch, =master=, has not moved.

If we examine the file ~biscuits.txt~ on the file system, it will show
the /gluten-free/ version. However, if we switch back to our old branch,
#+begin_src shell-script
git checkout master
#+end_src
the file is back to its /non-gluten-free/ state using wheat flour!

If we decide to change the recipe here to, for example, replace the "125g margarine" with "125g butter" and then
#+begin_src shell-script
git commit -a -m 'replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe'
#+end_src
#+begin_example
[master 5755eba] replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
#+end_example
then our ~git log --oneline~ does not show the ~gluten_free~ anymore
because it has diverged from the ~master~ branch:
#+begin_src shell-script
git log --oneline --all
#+end_src
#+begin_example
5755eba (HEAD -> master) replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe
01bb2d4 (gluten_free) make biscuits recipe gluten free
7d4a511 add link in cinnamon star recipe
bd180d6 restructure biscuit recipe
ad7f952 add recipe overview to README.md
957e0f7 add biscuit recipe
7dae468 add a cinnamon star recipe
efa0975 initial commit for recipes
#+end_example

At this point, we can use our user-defined ~git graph~ command
introduced here: [[file:sdl_change_files.02.org::*Examine the Commit History][Examine the Commit History]]:
#+begin_src shell-script
git graph --max-count 4
#+end_src
#+begin_example
 * 5755eba - (61 seconds ago) replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe (HEAD -> master)
 | * 01bb2d4 - (11 minutes ago) make biscuits recipe gluten free (gluten_free)
 |/
 * 7d4a511 - (25 hours ago) add link in cinnamon star recipe
 * bd180d6 - (25 hours ago) restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example

Note that we see the same when invoking ~gitk --all~, see
Fig. [[fig:gitk_first_branch][fig:gitk_first_branch]].
#+name: fig:gitk_first_branch
#+caption: A view on our repository using ~gitk~ after having
#+caption: introduced a first branch =gluten_free=.
[[file:./figures/task_03_060.png]]

Let us quickly update the description in ~README.md~ for our
gluten-free version:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git checkout gluten_free
#+end_src
and replace the content of ~README.md~ such that
#+begin_src shell-script
  git diff
#+end_src
#+name: src:add_typo
#+begin_src diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

 # Overview
-A collection of recipes
+A collection of gluten-free recipes

 ## Recipes
 So far we have:
-1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt))
+1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt), basd on buckwheat flour)
 2. Cinemon Stars (see [here](cinemon_stars.txt))
#+end_src
Note that we introduced a typo in "basd on" - this is on purpose and
we will correct it later. For now we can
#+begin_src shell-script
  git commit -a -m 'update README for gluten-free recipes'
#+end_src

Now ~git graph --max-count 4~ gives
#+begin_example
 * 34f83d7 - (2 minutes ago) update README for gluten-free recipes (HEAD -> gluten_free)
 * 01bb2d4 - (26 minutes ago) make biscuits recipe gluten free
 | * 5755eba - (16 minutes ago) replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe (master)
 |/
 * 7d4a511 - (25 hours ago) add link in cinnamon star recipe
#+end_example
so we only advanced ~gluten_free~ and kept ~master~ where it is. By
this use of /branches/ we can follow different development ideas in
the same repository.

** Create new branches at an earlier stage                             :cmds:
At this point, we might want to also add our vegan version. But the
~master~ branch just replaced "margarine" with "butter" - so that is
not a good starting point! Let's go to an earlier stage in history and
branch off there.
#+begin_src shell-script
  git branch vegan 7d4a511
#+end_src
Note that the number (the commit hash) will be different in your
case. It is the one just before ~gluten_free~ diverged from
~master~. Or where ~master~ diverged from ~gluten_free~ - both views
are correct.

Let us change to the new branch (~git checkout vegan~) and add a new
file ~substitutes.rst~ to list typical substitutes for non-vegan
ingredients:
#+begin_src rst
Typical replacements for Ingregients
------------------------------------

List of typical replacements for recipes:

+--------------+------------------------+
| Ingredient   | Replacement            |
+==============+========================+
| milk         | soy, almond, oat milk  |
+--------------+------------------------+
| egg          | chickpea water, banana |
+--------------+------------------------+
#+end_src
and then
#+begin_src shell-script
  git add substitutes.rst
  git commit -m 'add table of replcements in vegan recipes'
#+end_src
#+begin_example
[vegan eddd880] add table of replcements in vegan recipes
 1 file changed, 12 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 substitutes.rst
#+end_example

Oh no! This commit message also had a typo in it! If you want to
change the last commit message, then this can be done by
#+begin_src shell-script
  git commit --amend -m 'add table of replacements in vegan recipes'
#+end_src
#+begin_example
[vegan 49e8505] add table of replacements in vegan recipes
 Date: Wed Jan 12 11:36:39 2022 +0000
 1 file changed, 12 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 substitutes.rst
#+end_example

Note how the commit time was not updated! When /amending/ we create a
new commit taking certain aspects of the previous commit into account.
There can be pitfalls with this, see later: [[file:README.org::*SDL - Working with Remotes][SDL - Working with Remotes]].
So best not to use it too often.

Our overall history now looks like this:
#+begin_src shell-script
git graph --max-count 6
#+end_src
#+begin_example
 * 49e8505 - (4 minutes ago) add table of replacements in vegan recipes (HEAD -> vegan)
 | * 34f83d7 - (24 minutes ago) update README for gluten-free recipes (gluten_free)
 | * 01bb2d4 - (48 minutes ago) make biscuits recipe gluten free
 |/
 | * 5755eba - (38 minutes ago) replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe (master)
 |/
 * 7d4a511 - (26 hours ago) add link in cinnamon star recipe
 * bd180d6 - (26 hours ago) restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example


** Your Task                                                           :task:
Repeat the above steps and add a branch to your repository. Can you
examine the history with the commands we have learned before?

Feel free to add more steps to either of the two branches.
