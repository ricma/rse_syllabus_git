There are two reasons why you do not only want to have your code in the one ~git~
repository you are working in. One reason to copy it somewhere else is to have a
/backup/ as well as to be able to work on /different computers/ (e.g. using your
code on your laptop as well as on the HPC or a workstation). The other main
reason is /collaboration/.

* Using Local Directories
The first thing we are going to look at is creating a /remote/ on the very same
computer. It sounds a bit odd - but will allow us to play around with remotes
and get used to the concepts without having to set up complicated things on,
e.g. [[https://github.com]].

** Set up a bare Repository
If you have a look at your repository, you might have realised, that there is a
~.git~ folder at its base level:
#+begin_src shell script
ls -la
#+end_src
#+begin_example
total 28
drwxrwxr-x 3 martin martin 4096 Dec 14 13:29 .
drwxrwxr-x 5 martin martin 4096 Dec 14 13:34 ..
-rw-rw-r-- 1 martin martin  394 Dec 14 13:18 biscuits.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 martin martin  127 Dec 14 13:29 cinemon_stars.txt
drwxrwxr-x 8 martin martin 4096 Dec 14 13:45 .git
-rw-rw-r-- 1 martin martin  261 Dec 14 13:29 README.md
-rw-rw-r-- 1 martin martin  496 Dec 14 13:12 substitutes.rst
#+end_example
This folder contains all the database files for your repository, all the
history, local configuration etc.

Having all the actual files also there makes this folder a so called /working copy/.

In what follows, we will use so called /bare repositories/: These are essentially
only the ~.git~ folder without a working version of the files being present.

If you already have a repository (like we do), there are two ways of creating a
/bare/ version:

1. Clone your repository somewhere :: We use ~git clone~ using our /working copy/:
   #+begin_src shell-script
# let's go to the folder where our repository resides -- in my case in $HOME
cd ~/
git clone --bare recipe_book_example recipe_book_example.git
Cloning into bare repository 'recipe_book_example.git'...
done.
   #+end_src
It is common to call the folder for a /bare/ repository with a trailing ~.git~.

Now we have to folders here and the content of the ~.git~ folder inside our
/working copy/ looks similar to the /bare/ repository:
#+begin_src shell-script
ls recipe_book_example.git recipe_book_example/.git
#+end_src
#+begin_example
recipe_book_example.git:
branches  config  description  HEAD  hooks  info  objects  packed-refs  refs

recipe_book_example/.git:
AUTO_MERGE  COMMIT_EDITMSG  description  gitk.cache  hooks  info  objects    packed-refs  TAG_EDITMSG
branches    config          FETCH_HEAD   HEAD        index  logs  ORIG_HEAD  refs
#+end_example
We are not going to go into any detail about what this all is -- we just want to
emphasise that we won't be doing any actual work in the /bare/ repository.

Now with this repository in place, we can register it as a /remote/ in our working copy:
#+begin_src shell-script
cd ~/recipe_book_example
git remote add local ~/recipe_book_example.git
#+end_src
This creates a new remote calling it ~local~ and having it refer to the /bare/
repository we just created.

You can see all remotes set up by using
#+begin_src shell-script
git remote --verbose
#+end_src
#+begin_example
local   /home/martin/recipe_book_example.git (fetch)
local   /home/martin/recipe_book_example.git (push)
#+end_example

But so far, we have only told git about it -- not actually connected to it. For
getting the most current state of the /remote/ repository, you do
#+begin_src shell-script
git fetch local     # 'local' was the name of the remote we chose above
#+end_src
#+begin_example
From /home/martin/recipe_book_example
 * [new branch]      gluten_free_1 -> local/gluten_free_1
 * [new branch]      gluten_free_2 -> local/gluten_free_2
 * [new branch]      vegan         -> local/vegan
 * [new branch]      vegan_1       -> local/vegan_1
 * [new branch]      vegan_2       -> local/vegan_2
#+end_example

This tells us that there are several branches available on the /bare/ repository
and that they will be called ~local/xyz~ here.

If we call ~git log --all~ or ~gitk --all~, they will show the remote as well:
#+begin_src shell-script
git graph -n 5
#+end_src
#+begin_example
 * 04321c1 - (79 minutes ago) fix typo in README.md
 |           (HEAD -> gluten_free_2, tag: v_0.2_third_vegan_gf_version,
 |            local/gluten_free_2)
 * d1d1966 - (79 minutes ago) reformat cinemon recipe
 * 00cbb59 - (79 minutes ago) update README for gluten-free recipes (based on vegan)
 * f4e11d6 - (88 minutes ago) make biscuits recipe gluten free
 | * c85a553 - (3 hours ago) add link to table, add notes to recipe
 |             (tag: v_0.2_second_vegan_gf_version, vegan_1,
 |              local/vegan_1)
#+end_example

If we now add another commit onto the branch checked out (see ~HEAD~ above), e.g. by adding this to the ~README.md~
#+begin_src markdown
## Future Ideas
We should do more non-bakes!
#+end_src
and
#+begin_src shell-script
git commit -a -m 'add future ideas'
#+end_src
Now, ~gitk --all~ yields the below screenshot.

#+name: fig:gitk_after_conflict_resolution_rebase_2
#+caption: History after adding one more commit. Note the ~remote~ branches
#+caption: being shown.
[[file:figures/task_07_010.png]]

Note that the branch ~gluten_free_2~ exists twice: Once locally, once on the
remote.

We mentioned ~git fetch~ above to get the current state of a remote into our local
repositories database. To synchronise the other way around, use
#+begin_src shell-script
git push local
#+end_src
#+begin_example
Enumerating objects: 5, done.
Counting objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 443 bytes | 443.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To /home/martin/temp_dir_rse_course/recipe_book_example.git
   04321c1..dd3b759  gluten_free_2 -> gluten_free_2
#+end_example

If you check with ~git log --all~ or ~gitk --all~, you will see that the remote
~local/gluten_free_2~ is again at the same commit like ~gluten_free_2~.

Note: Sometimes ~git~ will complain about not being able to deduce what to push
where (names of branches might be different for you and the /remote/ you are
pushing to). In this case you can use
#+begin_src shell-script
git push local gluten_free_2:gluten_free_2
#+end_src
to be more explicit which of your branches you want to be pushed to which names.

*** Your Task :task:
Create your own bare repository and register it as ~git remote~.

You can either follow the above (~git clone --bare~ and register it) or you can
create a new empty, bare repository
#+begin_src shell-script
git init --bare ~/recipe_book_example_2.git
cd recipe_book_example    # this is the working copy we operate on
git remote add local2 ~/recipe_book_example_2.git
git push --all local2
git push --tags local2    # tags have to be moved explicitly
#+end_src

You can forget a remote to a repository by calling
#+begin_src shell-script
git remote rm local2
#+end_src
Note that this does not delete the data where you pushed it to (in this case
~~/recipe_book_example_2.git~ - you have to delete this separately)

** Playing around: Clone to another Working Copy
Having created a bare repository, we can now dive into what it means to
collaborate with others or working on different computers.

If none of that is for you, you can still use the above ~git remotes~ to create
backups. In this case, your ~git remote~ would not be on the same computer but,
for example, on an external drive or on a different computer (accessible via
~ssh~, for example).

But for the time being, we want to focus on how to use the bare repository and
look at proper /remote/ storage later.

First, we ~git clone~ the repository again - that means we create another
directory which also holds a working copy (and all the history):
#+begin_src shell-script
mkdir other
cd other
# the simplest command is
#   git clone ~/recipe_book_example.git
# alternatively, we could be more xplicit:
git clone --origin local_repo --branch main ~/recipe_book.git ./second_copy_recipe_book
#+end_src
#+begin_example
Cloning into './second_copy_recipe_book'...
done.
#+end_example

We can go into this repository and examine it
#+begin_src shell-script
cd ~/other/second_copy_recipe_book
git graph
#+end_src
#+begin_example

#+end_example
We see that it reflects the same history as in ~~/recipe_book~. To also have the
same /working copy/ (i.e. the same version checked out), we can do
#+begin_src shell-script
git checkout -b vegan_1 local_repo/vegan_1
#+end_src
#+begin_example
Branch 'vegan_1' set up to track remote branch 'vegan_1' from 'local_repo'.
Switched to a new branch 'vegan_1'
#+end_example

** Pretending to be Two Persons

Let us know pretend, that one of the copies is on one of your computers and the
other one on either another computer you work on (e.g. the HPC, a workstation,
or a laptop, …) or that it is someone else all together.

For simplicity, let us assume both copies have the branch ~vegan_1~ checked out,
both are where the /tag/ ~v_0.2_second_vegan_gf_version~ is.

Let us introduce different changes to different parts in both cases:
- ~~/recipe_book~ :: Let us fix the spelling mistake in ~README.md~ and
  ~cinemon_stars.txt~, i.e. /cinemon/ → /cinnamon/, ~git add~ and ~git commit~.

  As it also means renaming a file we can do ~git mv cinemon_stars.txt
  cinnamon_stars.txt~ and, at the same time, update the link in ~README.md~ to read
  #+begin_src markdown
## Recipes
So far we have:
1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt), based on using buckwheat flour, banana, and margarine)
2. Cinnamon Stars (see [here](cinnamon_stars.txt))
  #+end_src
  ~git add~ and ~git commit~ these changes as well:
  #+begin_src shell-script
  git commit -a -m'rename cinnamon star file, update link'
  #+end_src
  #+begin_example
[vegan_1 c484680] rename cinnamon star file, update link
 2 files changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
 rename cinemon_stars.txt => cinnamon_stars.txt (100%)
  #+end_example

- ~~/other/second_copy_recipe_book~ :: Change into this directory and change
  something else. For example add a sentence on using an appropriate
  cookie-cutter:
  #+begin_src shell-script
git diff
  #+end_src
  #+begin_src diff
diff --git a/cinemon_stars.txt b/cinemon_stars.txt
index 5ccf5d5..7d91066 100644
--- a/cinemon_stars.txt
+++ b/cinemon_stars.txt

 Prepare dough like written in [the biscuits recipe](biscuits.txt) but add 1/2 teaspoon of
 cinemon and 2 tsp of almond extract.
+
+Use a star-shaped biscuit-cutter to form the biscuits.
  #+end_src
  We ~git commit -a -m'add note on cookie-cutter'~ to commit these changes in the
  second repository.

Now, both repositories have a different state and both differ from the bare
repository they are both linked to. We can see this if we look at the most
recent commits on ~vegan_1~ in all of them:
- original working copy :: ~git -C ~/recipe_book graph -n 3 vegan_1~
  #+begin_example
 * c484680 - (14 minutes ago) rename cinnamon star file, update link (HEAD -> vegan_1)

  #+end_example

*** Your Task :task:
Add some changes yourself. These could be similar changes to the ones above, or
others. We will use the interactive session to see whether we can go through a
few examples.

** Synchronising the Work
We have seen what happens when you are updating a remote using ~git push~. If we
know that we will mostly push a given branch to a specific location, we can
#+begin_src shell-script
git push --set-upstream local vegan_1
#+end_src
#+begin_example
Enumerating objects: 9, done.
Counting objects: 100% (9/9), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.
Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 969 bytes | 138.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 7 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)

   c85a553..c484680  vegan_1 -> vegan_1
Branch 'vegan_1' set up to track remote branch 'vegan_1' from 'local'.
#+end_example
If we do that, then the next time a simple ~git push~ suffices.

If we go to our other repository and try the same, it fails:
#+begin_src shell-script
cd ~/other/second_copy_recipe_book
git branch --set-upstream-to local_repo/vegan_1
git push
#+end_src
#+begin_example
To ~/recipe_book.git
 ! [rejected]        vegan_1 -> vegan_1 (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to '~/recipe_book.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
#+end_example

~git~ won't allow us to move the branch to /our/ version of ~vegan_1~, as there is a more recent one!
To fix this, we have to
1. first get the new version over:
   #+begin_src shell-script
git fetch
   #+end_src
   #+begin_example
From /home/martin/temp_dir_rse_course/recipe_book
   c85a553..c484680  vegan_1    -> local_repo/vegan_1
   #+end_example
2. examine the situation
   #+begin_src shell-script
git graph -n 5
   #+end_src
   #+begin_example
 * 164f961 - (3 hours ago) add note on cookie-cutter

 | |           (local_repo/vegan_1)
 | |
 | * c8e3d72 - (3 hours ago) fix spelling mistake in README.md and cnemon_stars.txt
 |/
 * c85a553 - (28 hours ago) add link to table, add notes to recipe
 |           (tag: v_0.2_second_vegan_gf_version)
 |
 * 93a0b93 - (28 hours ago) add replacement for honey
   #+end_example
3. and combine the two versions
   #+begin_src shell-script
git merge local_repo/vegan_1     # note how we use a remote branch to merge to
   #+end_src
   #+begin_example
Auto-merging cinnamon_stars.txt

4. At this point we have to resolve the /CONFLICT/ just like we learned before.
   Here, it suffices to combine the correct spelling with the additional
   biscuit-cutter comment:
   #+begin_src markdown
- Prepare dough like written in [the biscuits recipe](biscuits.txt)
- Add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 tsp of almond extract.

Use a star-shaped biscuit-cutter to form the biscuits.
   #+end_src
   and run ~git add cinnamon_stars.txt~.
5. Before we finish the ~merge~, lets run a
   #+begin_src shell-script
git status
   #+end_src
   #+begin_example
On branch vegan_1
Your branch and 'local_repo/vegan_1' have diverged,
and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:
        modified:   README.md
        renamed:    cinemon_stars.txt -> cinnamon_stars.txt
   #+end_example
   Note how ~git~ just handled the rename without problems. This is because ~git~
   tracks file content rather than files or changes.
6. Note: The combination of ~git fetch~ and ~git merge~ is so common, that there is
   a short-cut for doing both: ~git pull~.

   Should you want to do ~git fetch~ followed by a ~git rebase~, then you can
   configure ~git~ to do this on a ~git pull~ instead using ~git config
   branch.autosetuprebase always~.
7. Finally, we can finish our merge as before
   #+begin_src shell script
git commit
   #+end_src
   Note that your editor will open and suggest a commit message like
   #+begin_example
   Merge remote-tracking branch 'local_repo/vegan_1' into vegan_1
   #+end_example
   We leave it at that, save, and close the editor to see:
   #+begin_example
   [vegan_1 9118a00] Merge remote-tracking branch 'local_repo/vegan_1' into vegan_1
   #+end_example
   and our history now looks like

8. Publish our changes. Now that our version (~vegan_1~) is a /fast-forward/ to
   ~local_repo/vegan_1~, we can
   #+begin_src shell-script
git push
   #+end_src
   #+begin_example

   c484680..9118a00  vegan_1 -> vegan_1
   #+end_example

We can now also go back to our first /working copy/ and synchronise the state there:
#+begin_src shell-script
cd ~/recipe_book
git pull
#+end_src
#+begin_example

 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)

And with this, both copies are at the same state again!

** Your Task :task:

Follow the above steps. Also try to ~git rebase~ and see what kind of history you
get.

What happens when during your merge your colleague pushes an even newer version?
