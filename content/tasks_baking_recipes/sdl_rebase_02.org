* SDL - Rebase a branch onto another branch - Example 2
In order to combine the content from the gluten-free and the vegan
branches in this example we will rebase ~gluten-free~ onto ~vegan~.
The [[file:sdl_rebase_01.org::*SDL - Rebase a branch onto another branch - Example 1][first example SDL]] a similar result but by rebasing the other way
around.

Just like we rebased our changes of ~vegan~ onto ~gluten_free~, we can do it the
other way around:

#+begin_src shell-script
# Create two new branches to start all over again with the rebase
git branch vegan_2 e40def1
git branch gluten_free_2 716409e
git graph -n 14
#+end_src
#+begin_example

 * 93a0b93 - (9 minutes ago) add replacement for honey
 * 28e0a1a - (9 minutes ago) add table of replacements in vegan recipes
 | *   3525589 - (11 months ago) merge gluten-free and vegan recipes

#+end_example
In particular note the above ~HEAD -> gluten_free_2~ which indicates the branch we
have checked out.

This time we check out the ~gluten_free~ branch and we rebase it onto ~vegan~:
#+begin_src shell-script
git checkout gluten_free_2
git rebase vegan_2
#+end_src
#+begin_example
Switched to branch 'gluten_free_2'
usuki% git rebase vegan_2

Weirdly enough, only the /biscuits.txt/ file seems to be affected. Looking at ~git log --graph~ shows:

#+end_example
Note that ~HEAD~ is now somewhere else - and compare it with the above message from ~git rebase~: It says
#+begin_example
Last command done (1 command done):
   pick 01bb2d4 make biscuits recipe gluten free
#+end_example
Can you spot this number, ~01bb2d4~ in the output? It is the one next to where ~HEAD~ now is.

So as we are rebasing /onto/ ~vegan~, we are already stuck in the first commit (~01bb2d4~) leading towards ~gluten_free~!

More specifically, the conflict in question shows as

What we can see here is:
- /HEAD/ :: This is where ~HEAD~ is in the above graph, i.e. the point onto which we are trying to apply our first change from ~gluten_free~.
- /parent of 01bb2d4/ :: This was the state of the file when putting the first
  commit in ~gluten_free~ in. Note that it is missing the "/(do not use butter!)/".
  The absence of this is the main reason the patch could not be applied without
  problems (no automatic resolving).
- /01bb2d4/ :: This is the change introduced by the first commit in ~gluten_free~

Just as before, let's come up with a joint "/truth/" and replace ~biscuits.txt~ with
#+begin_src markdown
# Ingredients
150g buckwheat flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
110g margarine (do not use butter!)
60g sugar (reduced because of banana)
3tsp vanilla extract
pinch of salt
1/2 banana

# Steps
- Mix butter and sugar, then whisk in egg
- add flour, baking powder, salt and stri until comes together
- let rest for 30 min in fridge
- roll out and cut into shape
- Bake for 12 - 15 minutes (180 degrees)
#+end_src

Note that we added a few descriptions for example justifying the use of less
sugar. As before, it might be that you cannot simply use one of the two
versions - you have to think about what the combined right thing is.

Now we can continue:
#+begin_src shell-script
git add biscuits.txt
git rebase --continue
#+end_src
Note: This will open your editor and allow you to change the log message for
this commit.

But then ~git~ struggles again!

  ## Recipes
  So far we have:
- 1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt))
+ 1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt), basd on buckwheat flour)
  2. Cinemon Stars (see [here](cinemon_stars.txt))

#+end_src

Let's replace this with a version we are happy with and continue:
#+begin_src shell-script
nano README.md    # ← fix the merge, create a good combined version
git add README.md
git rebase --continue
#+end_src
This time, let's change the commit message from
#+begin_src text
update README for gluten-free recipes
#+end_src
to
#+begin_src text
update README for gluten-free recipes (based on vegan)
#+end_src

This time ~git rebase~ continues to the end and we see:
#+begin_example
[detached HEAD 00cbb59] update README for gluten-free recipes (based on vegan)
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/gluten_free_2.
#+end_example

In order to be able to see what we have done, let's create a new ~tag~:
#+begin_src shell-script
git tag --annotate --message 'combined vegan and gf using rebase onto vegan' v_0.2_third_vegan_gf_version
#+end_src

Using ~gitk --all~ gives the following view:

The history shows the log after resolving the conflicts from rebasing
~gluten_free~ onto ~vegan~. Note the different order of the commit messages between
~vegan_1~ (where we rebased ~vegan~ onto ~gluten_free~), the ~tag…~ above ~gluten_free_1~
(the merged version), and ~gluten_free_2~ (where we rebased ~gluten_free~ onto
~vegan~).

The overall summary is: ~git merge~ is less trouble as you only have to combine
versions once. The cost it comes with is a /non-linear history/ as shown above.

** Your Task                                                           :task:
Like before, play around with the above situation. Don't be afraid of getting
into conflicts. You can always get out again by ~git rebase --abort~.
