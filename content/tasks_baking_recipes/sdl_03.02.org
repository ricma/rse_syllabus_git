* SDL - Showing differences between branches

Now that we have introduced several branches, let us try to find out
about there differences.

In real life, these branches would be branches in which a bug-fix is
being implemented or a new feature is brought to life.

** Looking at the difference between two branches
Just like ~git diff~ was able to show us the state of a changed file
(see [[file:sdl_02.01.org::*Examine the State of the Changed File][here]]), we can use it to display the difference between any two
commits in a repository. They don't even have to be in the same
branch. Here area few examples

#+begin_src shell-script
  git checkout vegan        # make sure we are on the `vegan`
  git diff gluten_free      # diff between HEAD (≡ `vegan`) and `gluten_free`
  git diff gluten_free vegan   # same as above but more explicit
#+end_src
#+begin_src diff

Using ~git log~ or ~gitk~, you can also use explicit commits to
compare. These all yield the same:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git diff 01bb2d4 5755eba
  git diff 34f83d7~ 5755eba
  git diff gluten_free~ 5755eba
  git diff gluten_free~ master
#+end_src

** Your Task                                                           :task:

Have a look around in your repository. Do you remember ~git log -G~
form [[file:sdl_02.03.org::*Finding Commits which introduced a certain Change][earlier]]? Despite being on branch ~vegan~ -- can you find the
commits which introduced ~buckwheat~? Hint: Use ~--all~ in ~git log~.
