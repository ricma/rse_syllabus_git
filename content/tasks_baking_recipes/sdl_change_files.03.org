* SDL - Examining single commits in more detail and Find Changes
This sub-task will introduce ~git show~ to show what a certain commit
changed. We will also introduce a way to search for certain changes
throughout the whole history.

** Show what changed in a certain commit
In order to see what changed in a certain commit we could either
invoke ~gitk~ and click on it or pick the somewhat cryptic number
reported to us by ~git log~ and call. This number is called the /hash
of the commit/. If we pick one here, we might enter (note that you
have to use different ones in your case!)
#+begin_src shell-script
git show ad7f952e647766763a5989264a6e8316f6a5a832

+## Recipes
+So far we have:
+1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt))
+2. Cinemon Stars (see [here](cinemon_stars.txt))
#+end_src
(Note: Like before: spelling mistake 'cinemon' instead of 'cinnamon' done
intentionally, we will fix it later)

Note that you don't have to specify the whole hash. It only has to be
unique enough. So in our case, it would suffice to call ~git show
ad7f~ to get the same output. A predecessor of a commit can be
indicated by =git show ad7f~=, its predecessor with =git show ad7f~~=
or =git show ad7f~2=.

** Finding Commits which introduced a certain Change
When you work on a repository with others for a while you sometimes
want to find a commit which either added or removed a certain
change. Remember: the files in your folder are just the actual state
of your source code or recipe book. But during its history there have
been many more things! Thanks to git these are not lost.

To show all commits which added or removed a certain phrase, do (note
that we also add ~--patch~ to see the change here as well)
#+begin_src shell-script
git log --patch -S flour

This ~-S~ only shows when the total number of occurrences changed but not other changes (for example if flour was moved within the text file). If
you want to see all additions and deletions, you can use ~-G~:

** Find who is responsible for a line of code

If you are working with others, sometimes it is helpful to know whom to ask about a certain line of code:
#+begin_src shell-script
git blame ./README.md
#+end_src
#+begin_example

ad7f952e (Martin Richter 2022-01-10 18:42:46 +0000 5) So far we have:
ad7f952e (Martin Richter 2022-01-10 18:42:46 +0000 6) 1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt))

#+end_example
In our case it is only one author so far but we do get information about _when_ a
certain change was made and we can look up the log message for that, for
example:
#+begin_src shell-script
git log efa0975

Examine your repository. Have a look at the first and second
commit. Also examine the most recent one (by either using its hash or
by using the name ~HEAD~).

Also search for certain changes using ~git log -S~ and ~git log
-G~. Can you combine those with ~--oneline~ or ~--color-words~?
