* SDL - Rebase a branch onto another branch - Example 1
In order to combine the content from the gluten-free and the vegan
branches in this example we will rebase ~vegan~ onto ~gluten-free~.
The [[file:sdl_rebase_02.org::*SDL - Rebase a branch onto another branch - Example 2][second example SDL]] achieves a similar result but by rebasing the
other way around.

** Getting back to before the merge
In order to compare what we are achieving with a rebase, let us go back to where
we were before the merge in [[file:sdl_merge_conflict_01.org::*Creating a merge conflict][a previous SDL]]:

1. Introduce new branches called ~gluten_free_1~ and ~vegan_1~ at the states where their originals were before we merged them into ~vegan_and_gf~. Note that the original branches might be gone if you deleted / renamed them [[file:sdl_merge_conflict_02.org::*Clean up branches][earlier]].
   #+begin_src shell-script
git branch gluten_free_1 716409e
git branch vegan_1 e40def1
   #+end_src
   Note that your numbers will be different and you have to take them from your
   repository.

   Your repository should look like this (where you can ignore the merge at the
   top (~3525589~) for this SDL.
   #+begin_src shell-script
git graph -n 11
   #+end_src
   #+begin_example
 *   3525589 - (11 months ago) merge gluten-free and vegan recipes
 |       (HEAD -> vegan_and_gf, tag: v_0.2_first_vegan_gf_version, github/vegan_and_gf)
 |\
 | *   716409e - (11 months ago) Merge branch 'fix_typo' into gluten_free (gluten_free_1)
 | |\
 | | * 4a5c4eb - (11 months ago) fix typo in README.md
 | * | 461de20 - (11 months ago) reformat cinemon recipe
 | |/
 | * 34f83d7 - (11 months ago) update README for gluten-free recipes
 | * 01bb2d4 - (11 months ago) make biscuits recipe gluten free
 * | e40def1 - (11 months ago) add link to table, add notes to recipe (vegan_1)
 * | ec39d14 - (11 months ago) add replacement for honey
 * | 49e8505 - (11 months ago) add table of replacements in vegan recipes (tag: v_0.1_vegan_replacement)
 |/
 | * 5755eba - (11 months ago) replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe (master)
 |/
 * 7d4a511 - (11 months ago) add link in cinemon star recipe
   #+end_example

2. Checkout one of the branches you just created. (And also note that a branch
   is nothing more than just a name for a point in the tree - pretty much like a
   variable name in a program can contain a value)
   #+begin_src shell-script
git checkout vegan_1
   #+end_src

** Rebasing the Changes from ~vegan~ onto the ~gluten_free~ branch
Now we are all set and we can put all the changes introduced in the branch ~vegan~
since we branched off from ~master~ onto all the changes in ~gluten_free~:

#+begin_src shell-script
git rebase gluten_free_1
#+end_src

#+name: output:git_rebase_1
#+begin_example
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: add table of replacements in vegan recipes
Applying: add replacement for honey
Applying: add link to table, add notes to recipe
Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
M       README.md
M       biscuits.txt
Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
Auto-merging biscuits.txt
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in biscuits.txt
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
error: Failed to merge in the changes.
Patch failed at 0003 add link to table, add notes to recipe
hint: Use 'git am --show-current-patch' to see the failed patch
Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
"git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
To abort and get back to the state before "git rebase", run "git rebase --abort".
#+end_example

Have a look at the first few lines of ths output: ~git~ is /Applying: …/ commits and
for two of them, this works without problem. Only the third one makes trouble
and results in /CONFLICT/.

The most important bit first: If you don't feel comfortable finishing this task, then
#+begin_src shell-script
git rebase --abort
#+end_src
brings your right back to before you started your attempt.

** Solving the CONFLICTs
However, we do feel up for the task and we instead have a look at the
repository:
#+begin_src shell-script
git status
#+end_src
#+begin_example
rebase in progress; onto 716409e
You are currently rebasing branch 'vegan_1' on '716409e'.
  (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
  (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both modified:   README.md
        both modified:   biscuits.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
#+end_example

More specifically, we have to investigate what is in this /both modified/ files:
#+begin_src shell-script
git diff README.md
#+end_src
#+begin_src diff
diff --cc README.md
index 4fa763f,68a50d7..0000000

  # Overview
++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +A collection of gluten-free recipes
++||||||| constructed merge base
++A collection of recipes
++=======
+ A collection of vegan recipes
++>>>>>>> add link to table, add notes to recipe

  ## Recipes
  So far we have:
 -1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt))
 +1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt), based on using buckwheat flour)
  2. Cinemon Stars (see [here](cinemon_stars.txt))

#+end_src

Before we continue, let us understand what are we seeing here.

At the very bottom, there is a part of the change which just got applied. There
was no conflict there as this was something which was only introduced in the
commit at the very end of the branch ~vegan_1~ (in our case ~e40def1~).

But there is more: Just like we had seen when solving the ~merge conflict~ [[file:sdl_merge_conflict_01.org::*Examining the merge conflict][earlier]],
there are certain markers in between which we see different
versions of the file (see [[file:sdl_merge_conflict_01.org::*Adding more information to merges: three-way-merges][here]]).

Now, there are lines indicating conflicts
1. *<<<<<<< HEAD*
2. *||||||| constructed merge base*
3. *=======*, and
4. *>>>>>>> add link to table, add notes to recipe*

Unlike when merging, the markers have different labels here. Between /HEAD/ and
/constructed merge base/, we see the version which is present in branch
~gluten_free_1~. You can check this by viewing a specific version of a file:
#+begin_src shell-script
git show gluten_free_1:README.md
#+end_src

The version between ~=======~ and ~>>>>>>>~ is the version at the commit with the
indicated commit message (in our case this is the same as ~vegan_1~).

The content between the two lines ~|||||||~ and ~=======~ is from the commit where
the two branches we are looking at diverged from. In our case this commit
happens to be the ancestor of the most recent commit in ~master~. We can therefore
either address it as ~7d4a511~ or ~master^~. So you can see the whole file by
calling
#+begin_src shell-script
git show master^:README.md
#+end_src

Just like before with ~git merge~, we have to decide what content we want. It
might be one of the three or a mix of them or none of them at all. You have to
decide what the correct answer is.

Let us enter [[file:sdl_merge_conflict_02.org::code:merge_conflic_solved][the same resolution like before]]: Copy the new content into the
~README.md~ /markdown/ file.

Now, we need to resolve the conflict in ~biscuits.txt~. For the sake of brevity,
we just do the same changes as earlier. We could use the merge we already
created for this. To see it, we can type ~git show
v_0.2_first_vegan_gf_version:biscuits.txt~. We can use this directly as our
version here as well:
#+begin_src shell-script
rm biscuits.txt
git show v_0.2_first_vegan_gf_version:biscuits.txt > biscuits.txt
#+end_src

After having put a version into both files we like, we commit and continue the
rebase:
#+begin_src shell-script
git add README.md biscuits.txt
git rebase --continue
#+end_src
#+begin_example
applying: add link to table, add notes to recipe
#+end_example

The line /Applying: …/ informs us that the change from this very commit is now
apply on top of the commits before, compare to the lines [[output:git_rebase_1][above]].

** Resulting History after the Rebase

The resulting state looks like this:
#+begin_src shell
git graph -n 14
#+end_src
#+begin_example
 * 078e2b8 - (46 seconds ago) add link to table, add notes to recipe (HEAD -> vegan_1)

#+end_example

Using ~gitk --all~ gives the following view:
#+name: fig:gitk_after_conflict_resolution_rebase_1
#+caption: History after resolving the conflicts from rebasing ~vegan~
#+caption: onto ~gluten_free~.
#+caption: The last commit of the ones being rebased is selected.
#+caption: Note how the /Author/ and the time is the old time but the
#+caption: /Committer/ is the one who did the rebase including the current time.
[[file:figures/task_06_010.png]]

The main difference to merges is that the resulting history is linear: Instead
of combining two branches together, we cut a branch off and position it on top
of an existing one. Also note in the ~gitk --all~ screenshot: The last commit of
the ones being rebased is selected. Note how the /Author/ and the time is the old
time but the /Committer/ is the one who did the rebase including the current time.

- Benefits :: You will get a linear version history which might be easier to understand later
- Drawbacks :: Rebases can be more complicated than merges as you can have
  /CONFLICTs/ in every commit you rebase. Above, we were lucky that it only
  happened at the last one. But it could have happened at every single /Applying …/ step.
- Caution with already published commits :: If you are working with others,
  rebasing might be less desirable if you have already shared your commits with
  others. Note how the commit with the label /add replacement for honey/ changed
  from ~ec39d14~ to ~70001cc~ – in fact, the commit with that description can
  therefore be seen twice in the above screenshot / history! If you have already
  copied ("/pushed/") it to a server, then you might not be able to easily copy
  your rebased version as this could lead to a loss of work.
- Advidse :: If you work on a separate part of code / text, create your own
  branch. This will reduce the amount of /rebases/ and /merges/ while copying your
  work to others. Only once your and/or their work is done, you combine it using
  a /merge/.

** Your Task                                                           :task:
Play around with the above situation. Don't be afraid of getting into
conflicts. You can always get out again by ~git rebase --abort~.

If you get stuck and want to start this task from the beginning, you can always
#+begin_src shell-script
# This is how you force your currently checked out branch to be somewhere else
git checkout vegan_1
git reset --hard  e40def1
# This is how you force a different branch to be somewhere else
git branch -f gluten_free_1 716409e
#+end_src

Alternatively, you could also start with two new branches ~vegan_1b~ and
~gluten_free_1b~ in all the above.

You only have to be careful in the same sense as for ~git merge~: If you call ~git
rebase~ and start adding changes, those changes will be lost when you abort. Git
can only protect things you committed. Before this, you might loose what you
have just done.

*** Subtask :task:
Try deliberately to loose data. The aim of this almost /counter exercise/ is to
give you a feeling for when you are doing things which are potentially
dangerous.

#+begin_src shell-script
# Create two new branches to start all over again with the rebase
git branch vegan_2 e40def1
git branch gluten_free_2 716409e
git checkout vegan_2
git rebase gluten_free_2
git status
#+end_src

This should leave you again in the conflict state mentioned above.
#+begin_example
interactive rebase in progress; onto 716409e
Last commands done (3 commands done):
   pick ec39d14 add replacement for honey
   pick e40def1 add link to table, add notes to recipe
  (see more in file .git/rebase-merge/done)
No commands remaining.
You are currently rebasing branch 'vegan_2' on '716409e'.
  (fix conflicts and then run "git rebase --continue")
  (use "git rebase --skip" to skip this patch)
  (use "git rebase --abort" to check out the original branch)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified:   README.md
	both modified:   biscuits.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
#+end_example
Now add some changes to, for example, ~README.md~:
Add the following line at the end:
#+begin_src markdown
## Additional Notes
I will get the Nobel Price for the following idea: ...
#+end_src
With this, ~git diff README.md~ yields
#+begin_src diff
diff --cc README.md
