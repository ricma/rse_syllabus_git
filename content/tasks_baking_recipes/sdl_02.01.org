* SDL 02.01 - Changing existing files
This sub-task will tell you why it is important to use simple text
files and how a version control system can help you keep track of
changes.

Before we change the files which are in the repository, let us get an
overview of which files _are_ in the repository:
#+begin_src shell-script
git ls-files
#+end_src
yields
#+begin_example
README.md
biscuits.txt
cinemon_stars.txt
#+end_example
Note that this is different from what we get when examining the folder:
#+begin_src shell-script
ls -a
#+end_src
shows also hidden entries (here these are entries which start with a dot: ~.~):
#+begin_example
.  ..  biscuits.txt  cinemon_stars.txt	.git  README.md
#+end_example
Note that there is a ~.git~. It is a directory which contains all
information relevant to this git repository.

** Change the Files in the Repository

Let us now change content of our ~README.md~ to read
#+begin_src markdown
  # Overview
  A collection of recipes

  ## Recipes
  So far we have:
  1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt))
  2. Cinemon Stars (see [here](cinemon_stars.txt))
#+end_src
to get a nicer overview of the recipes.

** Examine the State of the Changed File                               :cmds:
Once you have put this into the ~README.md~ file, we can call ~git
status~ again. This time we get:
#+begin_example
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
#+end_example

Note that changing an existing file is shown as /modified/ in
comparison to the above /new file/ when we were adding them.

We can see in a bit more detail what we have changed by calling:
#+begin_src shell-script
git diff
#+end_src
and we get
#+begin_src diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

+1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt))

#+end_src
Note how the line which was already three (/A collection of recipes/)
does not have a ~+~ in front while all the new lines are automatically
recognised as new.

Let us add these changes to the repository. We call
#+begin_src shell-script
  git add README.md
  git commit -m 'add recipe overview to README.md'
#+end_src

** Advice: Keep commits small and logically consistent        :best_practice:

Keeping commits small will later help you understand better not only
what you did but also what others did. It will greatly simplify should
you be looking for a bug using ~git bisect~ [[file:README.org::*SDL XX - Using Bisection to find Bugs][later]].

** Change the remaining files

Now let's also change the content of the two recipe files!
Let us change ~biscuits.txt~ to
#+begin_example
# Ingredients
250g flour
125g margarine
60g sugar
3tsp vanilla extract
pinch of salt
1 egg.

# Steps
- Mix everything
- let rest for 30 min in fridge
- roll out and cut into shape
- Bake for 10 - 12 minutes (200 degrees)
#+end_example
and ~cinemon_stars.txt~ to
#+begin_example
Prepare dough like written in [the biscuits recipe](biscuits.txt) but add 1/2 teaspoon of
cinemon and 2 tsp of almond extract.
#+end_example

** Committing the Changes to the repository                            :cmds:
A ~git diff~ now shows us all the differences we made. If we
explicitly state the filename, then it only shows the diff for this
file:
#+begin_src shell-script
git diff cinemon_stars.txt
#+end_src
#+begin_src diff
diff --git a/cinemon_stars.txt b/cinemon_stars.txt
index 43998d3..bdc5db2 100644

#+end_src
Despite the fact that we only inserted a few characters, git says we
have removed a whole line ( starting with ~-~ ) and added a completely
new one ( starting with ~+~ ).

If necessary, you can also highlight the changes on a word level using
~git diff --color-words cinemon_stars.txt~.

If we do a ~git diff biscuits.txt~, then we get a lot of lines with
~+~ and ~-~ because the content of the whole file changed. In cases
like this we can also just show a statistic:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git diff --stat biscuits.txt
#+end_src
and we get:
#+begin_example
biscuits.txt | 15 ++++++++++++---
1 file changed, 12 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
#+end_example

We can now add one file after the other -- this is where the /staging
area/ comes in handy: We add the changes as separate commits:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git add cinemon_stars.txt
  git commit -m 'restructure biscuit recipe'
  git commit --all -m 'add link in cinemon star recipe'
#+end_src

Note: You can use ~--all~ in ~git commit~ to commit all remaining
changed files.

** Your Task                                                           :task:
Repeat the above steps adding the two files to the repository. Feel
free to add more files to it as well.

What happens if you try to add a Word document? At this point, not
much. It would be added just like the other files. However, we would
get into trouble later, see xo

Repeat the above steps and change the files in the repository.
Examine the repository using ~git status~ before and after adding
changes to the staging area. And examine what you are about to commit
with ~git diff~.
