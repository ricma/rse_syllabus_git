* SDL - Add Some More Files
In order to see the basic operations, let us add files to the repository.
** Create some Files
Create a simple text file called =biscuits.txt= with the following content:
#+begin_example
Ingredients: 250g flour, 125g margarine, 60g sugar, 3tsp vanilla extract, pinch of salt, 1 egg.

Mix everything, let rest for 30 min in fridge, roll out and cut into shape.
Bake for 10 - 12 minutes (200 degrees)
#+end_example
Furthermore, create another file called =cinemon_stars.txt=:
#+begin_example
Prepare dough like written in biscuits.txt but add 1/2 teaspoon of
cinemon and 2 tsp of almond extract.
#+end_example
You can choose any text editor you want but please ensure you are
storing the information as simple text files, not Word documents.

*** Using the Command Line
Once the above file exists and are placed inside our ~recipe_book~
folder, we can have a look at the folders content:
#+begin_src shell-script
git status
#+end_src
This will tell you:
#+begin_example
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        biscuits.txt
        cinemon_stars.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
#+end_example
This tells you that there is a file called ~biscuits.txt~ but git does
not yet care about it (it is /untracked/).

If you can also use ~gitk~ (for example) to see the repository status:
#+begin_src shell-script
  cd ~/recipe_book    # go into our repository (if not yet there)
  gitk                # open `gitk` here
#+end_src
[[file:figures/task_02_010.png]]

You will see that your ~biscuits.txt~ is not there - again, due to it
being untracked.

** Add Files to the Index

Just like in [[file:sdl_01.01.org::*SDL - Create a New Repository][SDL - Create a New Repository]] above, we need to add
the files to the /index/ or /staging-area/. This makes git aware of
the fact that we are going to add these files to the repository soon.

*** Technical Background                                         :background:
The /staging-area/ might seem unnecessary at the beginning. But it will help
us later when we only want to work on a subset of changes rather than
all new things present in a repository.

*** Using the Command Line                                             :cmds:
To add the files to the index, do:
#+begin_src shell-script
git add biscuits.txt
#+end_src
Before you proceed with the second file: Have a look at the output of
~git status~ now! Then continue:
#+begin_src shell-script
git add cinemon_stars.txt
#+end_src
Now the status of the repository looks like this:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git status
#+end_src
#+begin_example
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   biscuits.txt
        new file:   cinemon_stars.txt
#+end_example

Note the above hint about the ~git restore~ -- apparently we can take
elements out of the index as well! Let's try!
#+begin_src shell-script
  git restore --staged biscuits.txt
  git status
#+end_src
and we get:
#+begin_example
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   cinemon_stars.txt

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        biscuits.txt
#+end_example

** Commit the New File
*** Using the Command Line                                             :cmds:
If we now commit what is in our staging area by calling
#+begin_src shell-script
  git commit --message 'add a cinemon star recipe'
#+end_src
we get this ~git status~:
#+begin_example
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        biscuits.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
#+end_example

Let us continue and add all remaining files: ~git add biscuits.txt~ and then
#+begin_src shell-script
git commit -m 'add biscuit recipe'
#+end_src

What does ~git status~ tell us now? For comparison, this is how the
~gitk~ window would look like:
#+name: fig:gitk_example_after_three_commits
#+caption: An overview of how our repository looks like after three commits.
[[file:figures/task_03_010.png]]

*** Advice: Use Meaningful commit messages                    :best_practice:

Note how we specified a _message_ explaining what we did using
~--message '...'~ or ~-m '...'~.  Alternatively, you can leave this
command line parameter away. Then an editor will open and ask you for
a _commit message_. Which editor that is depends on your
configuration. In an IDE or GUI it would probably be included.

The typical format of a commit message is
1. 50 characters on a single line
2. If you want to elaborate more, then leave one blank line and
   continue with now up to 72 characters.

While this sounds a bit strange, this has merit. Many tools will only
show you the short first line when presenting an overview, for
example (see for example [[fig:gitk_example_after_three_commits][above]]).

** Your Task                                                           :task:
Repeat the above steps adding the two files to the repository. Feel
free to add more files to it as well.

What happens if you try to add a Word document? At this point, not
much. It would be added just like the other files. However, we would
get into trouble [[file:sdl_02.03.org::*Show what changed in a certain commit][later when examining commits for their changes]].
