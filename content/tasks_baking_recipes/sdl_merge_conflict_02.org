* SDL - Solving Merge CONFLICTs
After we investigated what a /conflict/ looks like in
[[file:sdl_merge_conflict_01.org][Examining Merge CONFLICTs]], we can now solve it.

This SDL assumes the repository is back at a stage before all
conflicts:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git checkout vegan
  git graph -n 5
#+end_src
#+begin_example
 * e40def1 - (67 seconds ago) add link to table, add notes to recipe (HEAD -> vegan)
 * ec39d14 - (5 hours ago) add replacement for honey
 * 49e8505 - (6 hours ago) add table of replacements in vegan recipes (tag: v_0.1_vegan_replacement)
 | *   716409e - (4 hours ago) Merge branch 'fix_typo' into gluten_free (gluten_free)
 | |\
 | | * 4a5c4eb - (4 hours ago) fix typo in README.md
#+end_example

** Create and solve a merge conflict

We create our conflict:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git merge gluten_free
#+end_src
Then proceed step by step:

- Let us look at ~README.md~ first:
  #+begin_src shell-script
    git diff README.md
  #+end_src
  #+begin_src diff
diff --cc README.md
index 68a50d7,4fa763f..0000000

  #+end_src
- In order to include it in the merge, call
  #+begin_src shell-script
    git add README.md     # add resolved version to index for committing
  #+end_src
- Now the ~git status~ is
  #+begin_example
git status
On branch vegan
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Changes to be committed:
        modified:   README.md
        modified:   cinemon_stars.txt

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
        both modified:   biscuits.txt
  #+end_example
- Next let us look at ~biscuits.txt~:

  # Ingredients
++<<<<<<< HEAD
 +250g very fine flour
 +125g margarine (do not use butter!)
 +60g sugar
++||||||| 7d4a511
++250g flour
++125g margarine
++60g sugar
++=======
+ 150g buckwheat flour
+ 1/2 tsp baking powder
+ 110g butter
+ 110g sugar
++>>>>>>> gluten_free
  3tsp vanilla extract
  pinch of salt
 -1 egg.
 +1/2 banana

  # Steps
- - Mix everything
+ - Mix butter and sugar, then whisk in egg
+ - add flour, baking powder, salt and stri until comes together
  - let rest for 30 min in fridge
  - roll out and cut into shape
- - Bake for 10 - 12 minutes (200 degrees)

  #+end_src
- Based on these information, we can put in this resolved file:
  #+begin_src markdown
# Ingredients
150g buckwheat flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
125g margarine (do not use butter!)
110g sugar
3tsp vanilla extract
pinch of salt
1/2 banana

# Steps
- Mix butter, sugar and banana
- add flour, baking powder, salt and stirr until comes together
- let rest for 30 min in fridge
- roll out and cut into shape
- Bake for 12 - 15 minutes (180 degrees)
  #+end_src
- In order to include it in the merge, call
  #+begin_src shell-script
    git add biscuits.txt
  #+end_src

At this point, we resolved all conflicts and we can do:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git commit -m 'merge gluten-free and vegan recipes

  The biscuit recipe has been changed to be both vegan and gf.'
#+end_src
#+begin_example
[vegan 3525589] merge gluten-free and vegan recipes
#+end_example

** Clean up branches

Now that the information of gluten-free and vegan branches have been
merged, we can rename one branch and remove the other:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git branch -m vegan_and_gf
  git branch -d gluten_free
  git tag v_0.2_first_vegan_gf_version
#+end_src
Now the history looks like (~git graph~)
#+begin_example
