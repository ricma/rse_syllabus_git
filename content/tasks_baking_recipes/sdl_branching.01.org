* SDL - Creating new Branches
We will mimic different versions of a piece of software by introducing
different versions of recipes: We will create a vegan and a gluten
free version.

We do this by creating new /branches/. In simple terms, a branch is
just a name of a variable which references a point in our repository
history and which allows us to continue development from there.

** Create new branches                                                 :cmds:
To create a new branch at the current state, we can type ~git branch
gluten_free~. This creates a new branch called =gluten_free=
referencing the same point as the current state of the repository.

Now, a call to ~git log~ tells us that there is another branch:
#+begin_src shell-script
git log --oneline --max-count 2
#+end_src
#+begin_example
7d4a511 (HEAD -> master, gluten_free) add link in cinnamon star recipe
bd180d6 restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example

The line ~HEAD -> master~ tells us that our current working directory
is still on the old, original branch called =master=. Note that both
branches reference the same commit (~7d4a511~ in this case) and
therefore represent the same state of the repository.

To switch to the new branch, we can use
#+begin_src shell-script
git checkout gluten_free
#+end_src
and now the above ~git log~ would give
#+begin_example
7d4a511 (HEAD -> gluten_free, master) add link in cinnamon star recipe
bd180d6 restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example

We can see which branch we are on by calling ~git branch~ without any
further arguments:
#+begin_src shell-script
git branch
#+end_src
#+begin_example
 * gluten_free
   master
#+end_example
We get a list of all available branches and the one we are on is
marked with an asterisk.

** Add content to the new branch
To see the full benefit of branches, let us change some of the
contents to make the recipe gluten free:
#+begin_example
# Ingredients
150g buckwheat flour
1/2 tsp baking powder
110g butter
110g sugar
3tsp vanilla extract
pinch of salt
1 egg.

# Steps
- Mix butter and sugar, then whisk in egg
- add flour, baking powder, salt and stri until comes together
- let rest for 30 min in fridge
- roll out and cut into shape
- Bake for 12 - 15 minutes (180 degrees)
#+end_example

With the file ~biscuits.txt~ changed like this we can add it to the
staging area and commit it (see [[file:sdl_change_files.01.org::*SDL - Changing existing files][SDL - Changing existing files]]):
#+begin_src shell-script
  git add biscuits.txt
  git commit -m 'make biscuits recipe gluten free'
#+end_src
#+begin_example
[gluten_free 01bb2d4] make biscuits recipe gluten free
 1 file changed, 7 insertions(+), 5 deletions(-)
#+end_example

If we now have a look at
#+begin_src shell-script
git log --oneline --max-count=3
#+end_src
#+begin_example
01bb2d4 (HEAD -> gluten_free) make biscuits recipe gluten free
7d4a511 (master) add link in cinnamon star recipe
bd180d6 restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example
we see that our old branch, =master=, has not moved.

If we examine the file ~biscuits.txt~ on the file system, it will show
the /gluten-free/ version. However, if we switch back to our old branch,
#+begin_src shell-script
git checkout master
#+end_src
the file is back to its /non-gluten-free/ state using wheat flour!

If we decide to change the recipe here to, for example, increase the
amount of sugar to, say, replace the "125g margarine" with "125g butter" and then
#+begin_src shell-script
git commit -a -m 'replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe'
#+end_src
#+begin_example
[master 5755eba] replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
#+end_example
then our ~git log --oneline~ does not show the ~gluten_free~ anymore
because it has diverged from the ~master~ branch:
#+begin_src shell-script
git log --oneline --all
#+end_src
#+begin_example
5755eba (HEAD -> master) replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe
01bb2d4 (gluten_free) make biscuits recipe gluten free
7d4a511 add link in cinnamon star recipe
bd180d6 restructure biscuit recipe
ad7f952 add recipe overview to README.md
957e0f7 add biscuit recipe
7dae468 add a cinnamon star recipe
efa0975 initial commit for recipes
#+end_example

At this point, we can use our user-defined ~git graph~ command
introduced here: [[file:sdl_change_files.02.org::*Examine the Commit History][Examine the Commit History]]:
#+begin_src shell-script
git graph --max-count 4
#+end_src
#+begin_example
 * 5755eba - (61 seconds ago) replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe (HEAD -> master)
 | * 01bb2d4 - (11 minutes ago) make biscuits recipe gluten free (gluten_free)
 |/
 * 7d4a511 - (25 hours ago) add link in cinnamon star recipe
 * bd180d6 - (25 hours ago) restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example

Note that we see the same when invoking ~gitk --all~, see
Fig. [[fig:gitk_first_branch][fig:gitk_first_branch]].
#+name: fig:gitk_first_branch
#+caption: A view on our repository using ~gitk~ after having
#+caption: introduced a first branch =gluten_free=.
[[file:./figures/task_03_060.png]]

Let us quickly update the description in ~README.md~ for our
gluten-free version:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git checkout gluten_free
#+end_src
and replace the content of ~README.md~ such that
#+begin_src shell-script
  git diff
#+end_src
#+name: src:add_typo
#+begin_src diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

 # Overview
-A collection of recipes
+A collection of gluten-free recipes

 ## Recipes
 So far we have:
-1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt))
+1. Biscuits (see [here](biscuits.txt), basd on buckwheat flour)
 2. Cinnamon Stars (see [here](cinnamon_stars.txt))
#+end_src
Note that we introduced a typo in "basd on" - this is on purpose and
we will correct it later. For now we can
#+begin_src shell-script
  git commit -a -m 'update README for gluten-free recipes'
#+end_src

Now ~git graph --max-count 4~ gives
#+begin_example
 * 34f83d7 - (2 minutes ago) update README for gluten-free recipes (HEAD -> gluten_free)
 * 01bb2d4 - (26 minutes ago) make biscuits recipe gluten free
 | * 5755eba - (16 minutes ago) replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe (master)
 |/
 * 7d4a511 - (25 hours ago) add link in cinnamon star recipe
#+end_example
so we only advanced ~gluten_free~ and kept ~master~ where it is. By
this use of /branches/ we can follow different development ideas in
the same repository.

** Create new branches at an earlier stage                             :cmds:
At this point, we might want to also add our vegan version. But the
~master~ branch just replaced "margarine" with "butter" - so that is
not a good starting point! Let's go to an earlier stage in history and
branch off there.
#+begin_src shell-script
  git branch vegan 7d4a511
#+end_src
Note that the number (the commit hash) will be different in your
case. It is the one just before ~gluten_free~ diverged from
~master~. Or where ~master~ diverged from ~gluten_free~ - both views
are correct.

Let us change to the new branch (~git checkout vegan~) and add a new
file ~substitutes.rst~ to list typical substitutes for non-vegan
ingredients:
#+begin_src rst
Typical replacements for Ingregients
------------------------------------

List of typical replacements for recipes:

+--------------+------------------------+
| Ingredient   | Replacement            |
+==============+========================+
| milk         | soy, almond, oat milk  |
+--------------+------------------------+
| egg          | chickpea water, banana |
+--------------+------------------------+
#+end_src
and then
#+begin_src shell-script
  git add substitutes.rst
  git commit -m 'add table of replcements in vegan recipes'
#+end_src
#+begin_example
[vegan eddd880] add table of replcements in vegan recipes
 1 file changed, 12 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 substitutes.rst
#+end_example

Oh no! This commit message also had a typo in it! If you want to
change the last commit message, then this can be done by
#+begin_src shell-script
  git commit --amend -m 'add table of replacements in vegan recipes'
#+end_src
#+begin_example
[vegan 49e8505] add table of replacements in vegan recipes
 Date: Wed Jan 12 11:36:39 2022 +0000
 1 file changed, 12 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 substitutes.rst
#+end_example

Note how the commit time was not updated! When /amending/ we create a
new commit taking certain aspects of the previous commit into account.
There can be pitfalls with this, see later: [[file:README.org::*SDL - Working with Remotes][SDL - Working with Remotes]].
So best not to use it too often.

Our overall history now looks like this:
#+begin_src shell-script
git graph --max-count 6
#+end_src
#+begin_example
 * 49e8505 - (4 minutes ago) add table of replacements in vegan recipes (HEAD -> vegan)
 | * 34f83d7 - (24 minutes ago) update README for gluten-free recipes (gluten_free)
 | * 01bb2d4 - (48 minutes ago) make biscuits recipe gluten free
 |/
 | * 5755eba - (38 minutes ago) replace margarine with butter in biscuit recipe (master)
 |/
 * 7d4a511 - (26 hours ago) add link in cinnamon star recipe
 * bd180d6 - (26 hours ago) restructure biscuit recipe
#+end_example


** Your Task                                                           :task:
Repeat the above steps and add a branch to your repository. Can you
examine the history with the commands we have learned before?

Feel free to add more steps to either of the two branches.
