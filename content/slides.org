* Version Control: Reasons to Use It
# Title Slide

* What is Version Control?
A method to track chanes as you develop code

- and why to use it?

* Example of Branching

* Distributed Git
You might be working at
- a desktop computer
- and on a laptop
- you might have a workstation available somewhere
- or the HPC?

And this is all just you, a single person.

Additionally, of course: Collaborate with others!
- Use a server to act as a central point
- E.g. [[https://github.com]] or [[https://gitlab.com]]
  (the latter can also be hosted for free)

* Introduction to Git

Browse to
- the moodle page
  [[https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=150881]]
- Go to *Self-directed Learning Tasks*, will redirect you here:
  [[https://github.com/ricma/rse_syllabus_git/blob/main/content/tasks_baking_recipes/README.org]]
  #+begin_src python :exports results :results raw output
import qrcode

url = "https://github.com/ricma/rse_syllabus_git/blob/main/content/tasks_baking_recipes/README.org"
img = qrcode.make(url, border=1, box_size=6, error_correction=0)

filename = "./figures/qr_sdlts.png"
img.save(filename)
print(f"[[file:{filename}]]")
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  [[file:./figures/qr_sdlts.png]]

* Exercise 2 - Handling a Conflict in Real Code
Choose your language
- Python :: https://github.com/RichGraham/radius_python
- Fortran :: https://github.com/RichGraham/radius_fortran
- C / C++ :: https://github.com/RichGraham/radius_c
- Matlab :: https://github.com/RichGraham/radius_matlab
- R :: https://github.com/RichGraham/radius_r

Download the repository above
#+begin_src shell :noeval :exports code
   git clone https://github.com/RichGraham/radius_<YOUR LANGUAGE>
#+end_src

- Read the ﬁle ~README.md~ (visiting the url in a browser gives nice formatting)
- Explore the code and changes in each branch. Make sure you can
  run the code in each branch
- *Merge* the changes in =better-powers= and =proper-sqrt= as directed in the
  ~README.md~. Make sure the merged code runs as expected.
