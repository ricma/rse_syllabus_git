* Before you start
There are a few requirements. The most important one is, of course, having a ~git~ installation on your computer.

You can get /git/ here: [[https://git-scm.com]].

It mentions several download and install options. For example, if you
are on /Windows/ but cannot install software, you might want to try the portable version here:
https://git-scm.com/download/win (version ~v2.34.1~ at the time of writing).

If you download this and unpack it, then there is a ~PortableGit/git-bash-exe~.
If you start this, it will give you a command line like shown [[fig:git_bash_windows_01][below]] in which you can

In order to be independent from specific UIs or IDEs, we will mainly
focus on the command line here. Usually, the options in UIs and IDEs
are names very similar to the options here.

For computers at the University of Nottingham you can either use the
above portable version of ~git~ or see here:
[[https://workspace.nottingham.ac.uk/display/Software/Git+for+Windows]]

NB: For Computer Science it is available on the remote desktops:
https://rdweb.wvd.microsoft.com/arm/webclient

For a list of possible UIs for git, see:
[[https://git-scm.com/download/gui/windows]]

(I personally use [[https://desktop.github.com]] )

** Basic command-line usage
The session relies on some basic command-line usage. If you can use the command line to move around directories, create files and delete files then you will have enough for this part of the course. If you've never used the command-line before, you can open the command-line as follows:
	1. Windows - follow the installing git instructions above
	2. Mac - open the Terminal application, which is usually in /Applications/Utilities (or use spotlight or launchpad to search).
	3. Linux - search menus for the Terminal application.
	
To learn basic commands below are some videos introducing the key concepts or, if you prefer, there's a webpage with this information. Finally, there's a link to a crib sheet, which you might find useful in the session to help you remember the command-line commands.

** Other Helpful Things to Set
We will cover these later but let's mention them here to have them at one point
#+begin_src shell-script
git config --core.editor nano   # if you want to set a specific editor
# To get more context when encountering conflicts
git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
# To have a colourful graph representation of your history
git config --global alias.graph "log --graph --all --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset - %Cgreen(%cr)%Creset %s%C(yellow)%d%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative --decorate"
#+end_src
