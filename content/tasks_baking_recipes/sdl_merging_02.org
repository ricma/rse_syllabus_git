* SDL - A more complicated example and how to abort a merge
Let us re-visit the last example and look at it in more detail.

The main reason for this is to lay a foundation for the
[[file:README.org::*SDL - Merge Conflicts][more complicated merge case later]].

We will learn that /merging/ and /committing/ a merge commit are two
separate steps. The gap between the two allow us to amend necessary
changes.

** Revisit the merge situation
Just like [[file:sdl_merging_01.org::*Fixing the bug - Non-Fast Forwards][before]] we could use ~git reset --hard 461de20~ to force our
~gluten_free~ branch back to before our merge.

However, it is easier to just create a new branch and play around with
that instead:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git branch fix_typo 4a5c4eb   # we deleted that branch at the end of last SDL
  git checkout -b gluten_free_merge_again 461de20
#+end_src
This leaves us at
#+begin_src shell-script
  git graph -n 4
#+end_src
#+begin_example
 *   716409e - (3 hours ago) Merge branch 'fix_typo' into gluten_free (gluten_free)
 |\
 | * 4a5c4eb - (3 hours ago) fix typo in README.md (fix_typo)
 * | 461de20 - (3 hours ago) reformat cinemon recipe (HEAD -> gluten_free_merge_again)
 |/
 * 34f83d7 - (5 hours ago) update README for gluten-free recipes
#+end_example
We are on ~gluten_free_merge_again~ and ~git status~ reports
#+begin_example
On branch gluten_free_merge_again
nothing to commit, working tree clean
#+end_example
and we can have a look at the merge situation in more detail.

** Merging but don't commit yet
Almost identical to [[file:sdl_merging_01.org::src:cmd_merge_fix_typo_example][last time]], we now write
#+begin_src shell-script
git merge --no-commit fix_typo
#+end_src
#+begin_example
Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested
#+end_example

Now ~git status~ looks like this:
#+begin_example
On branch gluten_free_merge_again
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:
        modified:   README.md
#+end_example
To see which changes are in the staging area (note that the above says
"to be committed" - so just like after having ~git add~ a file!), we can
#+begin_src shell-script
git diff --staged
#+end_src
#+begin_src diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 21f7c73..4fa763f 100644

But let us assume we don't quite like the wording. We like that the
'bug' is fixed but we want to get rid of the 'using'. So simply edit
the file ~README.md~ and delete the word. Now ~git status~ reports
changes in the index and changes "not staged for commit":

We can finally commit. We could either type a ~-m 'merge fix'~ or we
can use the default message the merge has created for us. But where is
it? It turns out the message is stored in a text file called
~.git/MERGE_MSG~ and we can tell git to just use the content of this file:

This is mainly due to us having created a new branch to play around
with.

When viewed with ~gitk~, then we see, of course, the same:

** How to abort a merge
Most times merges will be easy, but sometimes git will not be able to
resolve the conflicts for you. In these cases, you have to fix the
situation by hand. Note that it is you, the programmer, the human
behind the keyboard who has to ensure that the *merge* *is* *what*
*you* *wanted* (e.g. by removing the above 'using', for example - but
we will see more compelling examples [[file:README.org::*SDL - Merge Conflicts][later]].

Sometimes, you might not be able to answer this right away! Maybe a
colleague introduced a new function and removed one of yours - but you
changed your function -- how should both bits be combined into a "new,
common truth"? You need to talk to each other! At this point it is a
good idea to /abort/ a merge you just attempted. This can be done as
follows.

Let us simply merge our two merges:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git merge --no-commit gluten_free
#+end_src
#+begin_example
  Already up-to-date!
  Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested
#+end_example
and a ~git status~ gives
#+begin_example
On branch gluten_free_merge_again
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)
#+end_example

To bail out, do
#+begin_src shell-script
  git merge --abort
#+end_src
and we will find ourselves back at commit ~3a8b32fc~:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git show --oneline --stat HEAD
#+end_src
#+begin_example
3a8b32f (HEAD -> gluten_free_merge_again) Merge branch 'fix_typo' into gluten_free_merge_again

 README.md | 2 +-
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
#+end_example

Finally, let us clean up:
#+begin_src shell-script
  git checkout gluten_free
  git branch -d fix_typo
  git branch -d gluten_free_merge_again
#+end_src
#+begin_example
error: The branch 'gluten_free_merge_again' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D gluten_free_merge_again'.
#+end_example
Interestingly, git does not let us simply delete branches which are
not merged into other existing branches! If you look at ~git graph~
you see, that ~gluten_free_merge_again~ is at the top of a branch in
our tree. Therefore we need to use
#+begin_src shell-script
  git branch -D gluten_free_merge_again
#+end_src
#+begin_example
Deleted branch gluten_free_merge_again (was 3a8b32f).
#+end_example

** Another comment on deleted branches etc.                      :background:
Like already mentioned before: the above hash (~3a8b32f~) does allow
us to bring this branch back to life even it is not part of our ~git
graph~ output anymore! As long as we can remember this number, we can
bring a deleted commit back. Git will not delete it for 90 days and
only if the repository is getting too big.

The take-home message is: Everything you have told git won't be lost
easily. You only have to be careful with changes _not yet
committed_. Git cannot help you there. But once you have committed
something, it is protected and you can get it back!

** Your Task                                                           :task:
Repeat the above steps. Try to merge different branches with each
other. If git answers with ~CONFLICT~, just abort the merge and try
something else!

We will treat these /CONFLICT/ situations in the next SDL.
